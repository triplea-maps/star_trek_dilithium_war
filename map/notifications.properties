Prologue=<body><img src="LogoPrologue.png"/><br><b>Stardate 48630.2:</b><br>The Dominion Cold War is destabilizing the Alpha Quadrant. Peace hangs by a thread. Only diplomacy<br>and clever politics is preventing an all-out war between the major galactic powers. Political alliances<br>frequently form, but they seem to be short-lived and dependent on political and situational needs.<br><br>A new and potentially explosive situation is starting to form just a few light years from the well known<br>Deep Space 9 space station. Scans of a nearly uninhabited region of space have shown a high<br>concentration of the valuable dilithium crystal. There is enough dilithium to support thousands of<br>starships and power-cores. This treasure could change the balance of power and predetermine the<br>outcome of a galactic war. Many governments have dispatched forces to the region, but it seems that<br>they are not alone...<br><br><b>Mission objectives:</b><br>Secure the region buy pressing the hostile powers out.<br>Hold 5 of the 7 Victory Centers to win (6 staring locations and the center planet of Radan).<br><br></body>

BorgAlarm=<body><center><img src="BorgEnter.png"/></center><br><b>Alert - The Borg have arrived!</b><br>Long range scans have shown a Borg-Probe entering the Radan System.<br>Their intentions must be to deploy drones, hold Radan and secure all the<br>dilithium for the Borg Collective. They will most likely build a base, call in<br>reinforcements and begin capturing all sources of dilithium in the region.<br><br></body>
